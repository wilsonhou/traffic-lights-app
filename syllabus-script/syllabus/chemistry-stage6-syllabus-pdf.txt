Introduction
Stage 6 Curriculum
NSW Education Standards Authority (NESA) Stage 6 syllabuses have been developed to provide
students with opportunities to further develop skills which will assist in the next stage of their lives.
The purpose of Stage 6 syllabuses is to:
●
●
●

●

●
●

develop a solid foundation of literacy and numeracy
provide a curriculum structure which encourages students to complete secondary education at
their highest possible level
foster the intellectual, creative, ethical and social development of students, in particular relating to:
– application of knowledge, understanding, skills, values and attitudes in the fields of study they
choose
– capacity to manage their own learning and to become flexible, independent thinkers, problemsolvers and decision-makers
– capacity to work collaboratively with others
– respect for the cultural diversity of Australian society
– desire to continue learning in formal or informal settings after school
provide a flexible structure within which students can meet the challenges of and prepare for:
– further academic study, vocational training and employment
– changing workplaces, including an increasingly STEM-focused (Science, Technology,
Engineering and Mathematics) workforce
– full and active participation as global citizens
provide formal assessment and certification of students’ achievements
promote the development of students’ values, identity and self-respect.

The Stage 6 syllabuses reflect the principles of the NESA K–10 Curriculum Framework and Statement
of Equity Principles, the reforms of the NSW Government Stronger HSC Standards (2016), and
nationally agreed educational goals. These syllabuses build on the continuum of learning developed in
the K–10 syllabuses.
The syllabuses provide a set of broad learning outcomes that summarise the knowledge,
understanding, skills, values and attitudes important for students to succeed in and beyond their
schooling. In particular, the attainment of skills in literacy and numeracy needed for further study,
employment and active participation in society are provided in the syllabuses in alignment with the
Australian Core Skills Framework (ACSF).
The Stage 6 syllabuses include the content of the Australian curriculum and additional descriptions
that clarify the scope and depth of learning in each subject.
NESA syllabuses support a standards-referenced approach to assessment by detailing the important
knowledge, understanding, skills, values and attitudes students will develop and outlining clear
standards of what students are expected to know and be able to do. The syllabuses take into account
the diverse needs of all students and provide structures and processes by which teachers can provide
continuity of study for all students.

Diversity of Learners
NSW Stage 6 syllabuses are inclusive of the learning needs of all students. Syllabuses accommodate
teaching approaches that support student diversity, including students with special education needs,
gifted and talented students, and students learning English as an additional language or dialect
(EAL/D). Students may have more than one learning need.

Students with Special Education Needs
All students are entitled to participate in and progress through the curriculum. Schools are required to
provide additional support or adjustments to teaching, learning and assessment activities for some
students with special education needs. Adjustments are measures or actions taken in relation to
teaching, learning and assessment that enable a student with special education needs to access
syllabus outcomes and content, and demonstrate achievement of outcomes.
Students with special education needs can access the outcomes and content from Stage 6 syllabuses
in a range of ways. Students may engage with:
●
●

Stage 6 syllabus outcomes and content with adjustments to teaching, learning and/or assessment
activities; or
selected Stage 6 Life Skills outcomes and content from one or more Stage 6 Life Skills
syllabuses.

Decisions regarding curriculum options, including adjustments, should be made in the context of
collaborative curriculum planning with the student, parent/carer and other significant individuals to
ensure that decisions are appropriate for the learning needs and priorities of individual students.
The Science Life Skills Stage 6 Syllabus has been developed from the rationale, aim and objectives of
the Investigating Science Stage 6 Syllabus.
Further information can be found in support materials for:
●
●
●

Chemistry
Special education needs
Life Skills.

Gifted and Talented Students
Gifted students have specific learning needs that may require adjustments to the pace, level and
content of the curriculum. Differentiated educational opportunities assist in meeting the needs of gifted
students.
Generally, gifted students demonstrate the following characteristics:
●
●
●

the capacity to learn at faster rates
the capacity to find and solve problems
the capacity to make connections and manipulate abstract ideas.

There are different kinds and levels of giftedness. Gifted and talented students may also possess
learning difficulties and/or disabilities that should be addressed when planning appropriate teaching,
learning and assessment activities.

Chemistry Stage 6 Syllabus

Curriculum strategies for gifted and talented students may include:
●
●
●

differentiation: modifying the pace, level and content of teaching, learning and assessment
activities
acceleration: promoting a student to a level of study beyond their age group
curriculum compacting: assessing a student’s current level of learning and addressing aspects of
the curriculum that have not yet been mastered.

School decisions about appropriate strategies are generally collaborative and involve teachers,
parents and students with reference to documents and advice available from NESA and the education
sectors.
Gifted and talented students may also benefit from individual planning to determine the curriculum
options, as well as teaching, learning and assessment strategies, most suited to their needs and
abilities.

Students Learning English as an Additional Language or Dialect
(EAL/D)
Many students in Australian schools are learning English as an additional language or dialect (EAL/D).
EAL/D students are those whose first language is a language or dialect other than Standard
Australian English and who require additional support to assist them to develop English language
proficiency.
EAL/D students come from diverse backgrounds and may include:
●
●

overseas and Australian-born students whose first language is a language other than English,
including creoles and related varieties
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students whose first language is Aboriginal English, including
Kriol and related varieties.

EAL/D students enter Australian schools at different ages and stages of schooling and at different
stages of English language learning. They have diverse talents and capabilities and a range of prior
learning experiences and levels of literacy in their first language and in English. EAL/D students
represent a significant and growing percentage of learners in NSW schools. For some, school is the
only place they use Standard Australian English.
EAL/D students are simultaneously learning a new language and the knowledge, understanding and
skills of the Chemistry Stage 6 Syllabus through that new language. They may require additional
support, along with informed teaching that explicitly addresses their language needs.
The ESL Scales and the English as an Additional Language or Dialect: Teacher Resource provide
information about the English language development phases of EAL/D students. These materials and
other resources can be used to support the specific needs of English language learners and to assist
students to access syllabus outcomes and content.

Rationale
The Chemistry Stage 6 Syllabus explores the structure, composition and reactions of and between all
elements, compounds and mixtures that exist in the Universe. The discovery and synthesis of new
compounds, the monitoring of elements and compounds in the environment, and an understanding of
industrial processes and their applications to life processes are central to human progress and our
ability to develop future industries and sustainability.
The course further develops an understanding of chemistry through the application of Working
Scientifically skills. It focuses on the exploration of models, understanding of theories and laws, and
examination of the interconnectedness between seemingly dissimilar phenomena.
Chemistry involves using differing scales, specialised representations, explanations, predictions and
creativity, especially in the development and pursuit of new materials. It requires students to use their
imagination to visualise the dynamic, minuscule world of atoms in order to gain a better understanding
of how chemicals interact.
The Chemistry course builds on students’ knowledge and skills developed in the Science Stage 5
course and increases their understanding of chemistry as a foundation for undertaking investigations
in a wide range of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) related fields. A
knowledge and understanding of chemistry is often the unifying link between interdisciplinary studies.
The course provides the foundation knowledge and skills required to study chemistry after completing
school, and supports participation in a range of careers in chemistry and related interdisciplinary
industries. It is an essential discipline that currently addresses and will continue to address our energy
needs and uses, the development of new materials, and sustainability issues as they arise.

Working Scientifically
Working Scientifically skills are at the core of conducting practical and secondary-sourced
investigations in science.
Opportunities should be provided for students to engage with all the Working Scientifically skills in
investigations. In each module, particular outcomes have been identified as those that are most
relevant to the intended learning.
Students are challenged to further develop their understanding of Working Scientifically as a group of
dynamic and interdependent processes that are applied in each scientific investigation in a way that is
appropriate and determined by the activity. This dynamism and interrelatedness adds a level of
sophistication to students’ understanding of the true nature and practice of science. Through regular
involvement in these processes, applying them as appropriate, in a range of varied practical
investigations, students can broaden their interpretation of Working Scientifically beyond the common
linear model.
Students are encouraged to select the most appropriate gateway to the Working Scientifically
processes. The pathways within the processes become self-evident through the nature of the
investigation. An investigation may be instigated by, for example:
●
●
●
●

direct observation of a phenomenon
inconsistencies arising from results of a related investigation
the qualitative and quantitative analysis of data
secondary-sourced research.

Students are challenged to be open to:
●
●
●
●
●

refining or redeveloping their chosen procedures
redefining their questions and/or hypotheses
modifying their methodologies or designs
conducting further practical investigations
conducting further secondary research.

Students are also encouraged to communicate evidence-based conclusions and suggest ideas for
future research. Unexpected results are to be welcomed to refine methodologies and to generate
further investigation. Knowledge and understanding of science is essential to these processes.
Through this practice of science, students can acquire a deeper knowledge and understanding of
scientific concepts.

Chemistry Stage 6 Syllabus

21

Each of the seven Working Scientifically outcomes represents one of the interdependent dynamic
processes that are central to the study of science and the acquisition of scientific knowledge and
skills. This course is structured to provide ongoing opportunities for students to implement these
processes, particularly through the depth study provision. The following descriptions of the Working
Scientifically outcomes provide further information about the skills students are expected to develop
throughout the course.

Questioning and Predicting
Developing, proposing and evaluating inquiry questions and hypotheses challenges students to
identify an issue or phenomenon that can be investigated scientifically by gathering primary and/or
secondary-sourced data. Students develop inquiry question(s) that require observations,
experimentation and/or research to aid in constructing a reasonable and informed hypothesis. The
consideration of variables is to be included in the questioning process.

Chemistry Stage 6 Syllabus

22

Planning Investigations
Students justify the selection of equipment, resources chosen and design of an investigation. They
ensure that all risks are assessed, appropriate materials and technologies are sourced, and all ethical
concerns are considered. Variables are to be identified as independent, dependent and controlled to
ensure a valid procedure is developed that will allow for the reliable collection of data. Investigations
should include strategies that ensure controlled variables are kept constant and an experimental
control is used as appropriate.

Conducting Investigations
Students are to select appropriate equipment, employ safe work practices and ensure that risk
assessments are conducted and followed. Appropriate technologies are to be used and procedures
followed when disposing of waste. The selection and criteria for collecting valid and reliable data is to
be methodical and, where appropriate, secondary-sourced information referenced correctly.

Processing Data and Information
Students use the most appropriate and meaningful methods and media to organise and analyse data
and information sources, including digital technologies and the use of a variety of visual
representations as appropriate. They process data from primary and secondary sources, including
both qualitative and quantitative data and information.

Analysing Data and Information
Students identify trends, patterns and relationships; recognise error, uncertainty and limitations in
data; and interpret scientific and media texts. They evaluate the relevance, accuracy, validity and
reliability of the primary or secondary-sourced data in relation to investigations. They evaluate
processes, claims and conclusions by considering the quality of available evidence, and use
reasoning to construct scientific arguments. Where appropriate, mathematical models are to be
applied to demonstrate the trends and relationships that occur in data.

Problem Solving
Students use critical thinking skills and creativity to demonstrate an understanding of scientific
principles underlying the solutions to inquiry questions and problems posed in investigations.
Appropriate and varied strategies are employed, including the use of models, to qualitatively and
quantitatively and explain and predict cause-and-effect relationships. In Working Scientifically,
students synthesise and use evidence to construct and justify conclusions. To solve problems,
students: interpret scientific and media texts; evaluate processes, claims and conclusions; and
consider the quality of available evidence.

Communicating
Communicating all components of the Working Scientifically processes with clarity and accuracy is
essential. Students use qualitative and quantitative information gained from investigations using
primary and secondary sources, including digital, visual, written and/or verbal forms of communication
as appropriate. Students apply appropriate scientific notations and nomenclature. They also
appropriately apply and use scientific language that is suitable for specific audiences and contexts.

Chemistry Stage 6 Syllabus

23

Investigations
An investigation is a scientific process to answer a question, explore an idea or solve a problem.
Investigations include activities such as planning a course of action, collecting data, processing and
analysing data, reaching a conclusion and communicating. Investigations may include the collection of
primary and/or secondary-sourced data or information.
Practical investigations involve the collection of primary data. They may include:
●
●
●

undertaking laboratory investigations, including fair tests and controlled experiments
undertaking fieldwork and surveys
constructing models.

Secondary-sourced investigations can include:
●
●
●

researching by using a variety of media
extracting and reorganising secondary-sourced information in the form of flow charts, tables,
graphs, diagrams, prose, keys, spreadsheets and databases
using models to inform understanding.

Safety
Schools have a legal obligation in relation to safety. Teachers will need to ensure that they comply
with relevant legislation as well as system and school requirements in relation to safety when
implementing their programs. This includes legislation and guidelines relating to Work Health and
Safety, and the handling and storage of chemical and dangerous goods.

Animal Research
Schools have a legal responsibility in relation to the welfare of animals. The keeping of animals and all
practical activities involving animals must comply with relevant guidelines or legislation.

Inquiry Questions
Inquiry questions are included in the course content and used to frame the syllabus content within
each module. The depth of knowledge and understanding and skill development required to fully
address the inquiry questions may vary. This allows for differentiation of the course content to cater
for the diversity of learners.

Depth Studies: Year 11 and Year 12
What are Depth Studies?
A depth study is any type of investigation/activity that a student completes individually or
collaboratively that allows the further development of one or more concepts found within or inspired by
the syllabus. It may be one investigation/activity or a series of investigations/activities.
Depth studies provide opportunities for students to pursue their interests in chemistry, acquire a depth
of understanding, and take responsibility for their own learning. Depth studies promote differentiation
and engagement, and support all forms of assessment, including assessment for, as and of learning.
Depth studies allow for the demonstration of a range of Working Scientifically skills.
A depth study may be, but is not limited to:
●
●
●

a practical investigation or series of practical investigations and/or a secondary-sourced
investigation or series of secondary-sourced investigations
presentations, research assignments or fieldwork reports
the extension of concepts found within the course, either qualitatively and/or quantitatively.

The length of time for any individual study and the pedagogies employed are not prescribed. The time
for the depth studies may be allocated to a single study or spread over the year, and incorporate
several studies depending on individual school and/or class requirements.

Requirements for Depth Studies
●
●
●
●

A minimum of 15 hours of in-class time is allocated in both Year 11 and Year 12.
At least one depth study must be included in both Year 11 and Year 12.

Chemistry Stage 6 Syllabus

28

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Histories and Cultures
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities have diverse cultures, social structures and a
history of unique, complex knowledge systems. In Chemistry students are provided with opportunities
to learn about how Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples have developed and refined
knowledge about the world through observation, making predictions, testing (trial and error) and
responding to environmental factors within specific contexts. Students investigate examples of
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples’ understanding of the environment and the ways in
which traditional knowledge and Western scientific knowledge can be complementary.

Asia and Australia’s Engagement with Asia
Asia and Australia’s engagement with Asia provides rich and engaging contexts for developing
students’ scientific and technological knowledge, understanding and skills. In Chemistry students are
provided with opportunities to recognise that the Asia region includes diverse environments. They are
provided with opportunities to appreciate how interactions within and between these environments
and the impacts of human activity influence the region, including Australia, and have significance for
the rest of the world.
Asia plays an important role in scientific and technological research and development in areas such
as medicine, natural resource management and natural disaster prediction and management.

Sustainability
Sustainability is concerned with the ongoing capacity of the Earth to maintain all life. It provides
authentic contexts for exploring, investigating and understanding systems in natural and human-made
environments. In Chemistry students are provided with opportunities to investigate relationships
between systems and system components, and consider the sustainability of food sources and the
natural and human environments. They engage in ethical debate and with different perspectives in
solving ethical problems.

Critical and Creative Thinking
Critical and creative thinking are integral to activities where students learn to generate and evaluate
knowledge, clarify concepts and ideas, seek possibilities, consider alternatives and solve problems.
Critical and creative thinking are embedded in the skills and processes of Working Scientifically. In
order to make evidence-based decisions, students are provided with opportunities to develop critical
and creative thinking skills through: asking and posing questions; making predictions; engaging in
practical and secondary-source investigations; and analysing and evaluating evidence.

Ethical Understanding
Students are provided with opportunities to develop the capability to assess ethical values and
principles, and to understand how reasoning can assist ethical judgement. In Chemistry students are
provided with opportunities to form and make ethical judgements in relation to scientific investigations,
design, codes of practice, and the use of scientific information and applications. Students explore the
importance of reporting honestly based on evidence. They apply ethical guidelines in their
investigations, particularly in regard to the implications for others and the environment.

Information and Communication Technology Capability
Information and communication technology (ICT) can be used effectively and appropriately to access,
create and communicate information and ideas, solve problems and work collaboratively. In Chemistry
students are provided with opportunities to develop ICT capability when they: develop ideas, concepts
and solutions; research science concepts and applications; investigate scientific phenomena; and
communicate their scientific and technological understandings. In particular, they have opportunities
to learn to: access information; collect, analyse and represent data; model and interpret concepts and
relationships; and communicate scientific and technological ideas, processes and information.

Intercultural Understanding
Students develop intercultural understanding as they learn to understand themselves in relation to
others. This involves students valuing their own cultures and those of others, and engaging with
people of diverse cultures in ways that recognise commonalities and differences, create connections
and cultivate respect. In Chemistry students are provided with opportunities to appreciate how diverse
cultural perspectives have impacted on the development, breadth and diversity of scientific knowledge
and applications. They learn about and engage with issues requiring cultural sensitivity, and learn that
scientists work in culturally diverse teams to address issues and solve problems of national and
international importance.

Literacy
Literacy is the ability to use a repertoire of knowledge and skills to communicate and comprehend
effectively, using a variety of modes and media. Being ‘literate’ is more than the acquisition of
technical skills – it includes the ability to identify, understand, interpret, create and communicate
effectively using written, visual and digital forms of expression and communication for a number of
purposes. In Chemistry students are provided with opportunities to understand that language varies
according to the context and engage with different forms of written and spoken language to
communicate scientific concepts. They learn that scientific information can also be presented in the
form of diagrams, flow charts, tables, graphs and models.

Numeracy
Numeracy involves recognising and understanding the role of mathematics in the world. Students
become numerate as they develop the confidence, willingness and ability to apply mathematics in
their lives in constructive and meaningful ways. In Chemistry students are provided with opportunities
to develop numeracy skills through practical measurement and the collection, representation and
interpretation of data from first-hand investigations and secondary sources. Students consider issues
of uncertainty and reliability in measurement and have opportunities to learn data analysis skills,
identifying trends and patterns from numerical data and graphs. They apply mathematical equations
and concepts in order to solve problems.

Personal and Social Capability
Students develop personal and social capability as they learn to understand and manage themselves,
their relationships and their lives more effectively. This includes establishing positive relationships,
making responsible decisions, working effectively individually and in teams, and constructively
handling challenging situations. Through applying the processes of Working Scientifically, students
can develop skills in collaboration, peer assessment and review. They plan and conduct a depth
study, either individually or in a team.

Civics and Citizenship
Civics and citizenship content involves knowledge and understanding of how our Australian society
operates. In Chemistry students are provided with opportunities to broaden their understanding of
aspects of civics and citizenship related to the application of scientific ideas and technological
advances, including ecological sustainability and the development of environmental and sustainable
practices at a local, regional and national level.

Difference and Diversity
Difference and diversity comprise gender, race and socio-economic circumstances. Students are
provided with opportunities to understand and appreciate the difference and diversity they experience
in their everyday lives. Working Scientifically provides opportunities for students to work
collaboratively, where they can develop an appreciation of the values and ideas of all group members.
This appreciation also enables students to identify individual rights, challenge stereotypes and engage
with opinions that are different to their own.

Work and Enterprise
Students can develop work-related skills and an appreciation of the value of working individually and
collaboratively when conducting investigations. In Chemistry students are provided with opportunities
for students to prioritise safe practices and understand the potential risks and hazards present when
conducting investigations. They engage with risk assessment while working safely in the laboratory or
the field.

Content Focus
Students analyse trends and patterns in relation to the properties of pure substances and use these to
predict the properties of other pure substances. This knowledge is used to determine the ways in which
substances can be separated from each other and those that allow them to remain together.
Matter can be either pure substances with distinct measurable properties (eg melting and boiling points,
reactivity, strength, density) or mixtures with properties that are dependent on the identity and relative
amounts of the substances that make up the mixture. The analysis of these properties has led to the
expansion of the periodic table of elements and the advancement of atomic theory. This understanding has
allowed for the development of complex models that have been subject to extensive peer review, and has
contributed to advances in many disciplines over time.
Students use knowledge obtained from the study of the periodic table to examine trends and patterns that
exist between chemical elements and atoms in order to discover that fundamental particles, and their role in
the structure of an atom, give all chemicals their properties.

Working Scientifically
In this module, students focus on: designing, evaluating and conducting investigations; obtaining and
processing data in the most appropriate manner; and communicating ideas about the structural, physical and
chemical aspects of matter. Students should be provided with opportunities to engage with all Working
Scientifically skills throughout the course.

Content Focus
Chemical systems may be open or closed. They include physical changes and chemical reactions that can
result in observable changes to a system. Students study the effects of changes in temperature,
concentration of chemicals and pressure on equilibrium systems, and consider that these can be predicted
by applying Le Chatelier’s principle. Students also analyse the quantitative relationship between products
and reactants in equilibrium reactions to determine an equilibrium constant. From this calculation, they
predict the equilibrium position, either favouring the formation of products or reactants in a chemical reaction.
This module also allows students to understand that scientific knowledge enables scientists to offer valid
explanations and make reliable predictions. Students make reliable predictions by comparing equilibrium
calculations and equilibrium constants to determine whether a combination of two solutions will result in the
formation of a precipitate.

Working Scientifically
In this module, students focus on processing data to determine patterns and trends that enable them to
solve problems and communicate scientific understanding of ideas about equilibrium reactions. Students
should be provided with opportunities to engage with all the Working Scientifically skills throughout the
course.
